# LinkUp

Add our bot to your Discord server:

[Add me](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1049672170718105600&permissions=3072&scope=applications.commands%20bot)


## Inspiration
We searched for a new way to connect people who are looking for someone to play with. Our first idea was a website, but people would need to actively search for that and the process of registering there can be time consuming. We then had the idea to just integrate this feature, right where gamers already are, in discord!

## What it does
Any Discord server can add our bot. There, people can message the bot privately. First, they enter their preferred region. Now all there is to do, is to enter the "queue" for the game of your choice. Our bot will send you a message once a potential gaming partner is found. Through our bot, you can securely chat with the other person, without the need to befriend a person in discord. If you are both hitting it up, just add the other person.
 
How it works:

**1)**  /set region

Description: Allows you to set the region, where you are looking for other players

**2)** /"Name of the game" 

Description: Type in the game of your choice. As soon as you entered it, our bot is looking for potential team mates and will connect you.

## How we built it
We built our bot with python and integrated it to discord. 

## Challenges we ran into
We want a new and innovative product with many features. But time always plays a role, so we had to decide which feature can be included in time. We didn't want to release a product that is only half working, so we focused on the core part. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to get our proof of concept out there, live for people to test and connect. We now have a foundation we can build on. 


## What's next for LinkUp
For now it is a more casual experience where you can simply look for new people to play with. For more serious gamers who are looking for skillful teammates we will implement a way to also enter your skill level and describe more precisely what you are looking for. That way E-sport groups could even recruit people and send a hiring message to potential new players.
